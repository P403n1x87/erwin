## Preamble

Please try to keep the code as modular as possible. Also keep an eye to the
future and try to envisage a solution that can work with any two file systems.

## Opening PRs

Everybody is more than welcome to open a PR to fix a bug/propose enhancements/

style guides as much as possible.


### Git Commit Messages

This style guide is taken from the Atom project.

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

In addition to these rules, please consider applying the [conventional
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines too.

### Labels

When opening a new PR, please apply a label to them. Try to use existing labels
as much as possible and only create a new one if the current ones are not
applicable.
